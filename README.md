# blockchain-workshop
This is a simple blockchain featuring a local p2p network, simple mempool and concensus for educational purposes.

# Step 3

We will create a data struct to represent our messages (transactions).

We will create a storage (mempool) for our messages (transactions).

We'll have to perform some basic deserialization of data incoming from the network.

We were successful if we are now sending messages across the network and storing them in local mempool.
